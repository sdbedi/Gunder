# About Gunder
Gunder is short for Gunderscore (or G_underscore). I originally wanted to call it Godash, but it appears that name is already taken. 

This is intended to be a library of utility functions for Golang, a Golang equivalent of popular Javascript libraries such as Underscore or Lodash. Functional programming of this nature isn't popular in Go-witness the lack of native methods like map or filter-and there have been a couple unsuccessful attempts to create this kind of library. I still feel this is a good learning exercise. Moreover, with the coming implementation of Generics in Go, this may become more feasible.
